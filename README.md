Assignment 2: Aequilibrium - Transformation Company

Hi Serg,

I'm very happy to help Aequilibrium create a program that reports about the war between Autobots and Decepticons. 
(But believe it or not, no matter what the program may say, Autobots will win in the end).

## How the program works
It takes a csv file (battle.csv) as the input and will make a report about how many battles occured, who won, and who survived. Just simply modify the _battle.csv_ file, and run the _BattleInterface.java_ to see the report.

## Assumption: 
* The input is always valid. A valid input must have the format described in the first row of the csv file.
* Transformers are sorted by rank in ascending order.

_It's a very fun coding challenge to do! Thank you for giving me this challenge. I hope the code is readable and easy to understand. I really looking forward to working with you guys!_
